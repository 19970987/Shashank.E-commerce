# E-commerce website scraping.
"This is a E-commerce website scraping end to end project."
--> In this project, I implemented web scraping of an e-commerce website using Beautiful Soup and Python to extract the price of a MacBook. The extracted price data is then monitored for updates, and in case of any changes, an automated email notification is sent via Outlook using Python's built-in email functionality. Additionally, I developed a user-friendly interface using Streamlit framework for easy monitoring and interaction with the price tracking system.
